# CODEOWNERS - Define code ownership for automated PR review assignment
#
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The last matching pattern takes precedence.
#
# Owners can be @username, @org/team-name, or email addresses.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# How to customize:
#   1. Replace @your-org/team with your actual GitHub org/team or username
#   2. Add patterns for your project structure
#   3. More specific patterns should come after general ones

# Default owner for everything
* @your-org/maintainers

# /docs/ @your-org/docs-team
# *.md @your-org/docs-team
